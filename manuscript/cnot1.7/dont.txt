[Intro]
| Em     | Em     | Em     | Em     |


[Verse 1]
| Em           | G          |
She leaves and I stay  
| Em           | D          |
like a folder left open  
| Em           | C          |
half full, half erased  
| Em           | Em         |
I blink, and she's already gone  


[Verse 2]
| Em           | G          |
She goes to New York  
| Em           | D          |
I stay with a lamp shaped like a heart  
| Em           | C          |
plastic love, three settings  
| Em           | Em         |
warm, cold, ambient—mine is blinking  


[Chorus]
| G            | D          |
I’m not angry, I’m just here  
| Bm           | C          |
in the silence you left, in the flicker of fear  
| G            | D          |
you’re a pixel away, and I’m still near  
| Bm           | C          |
singing softly where you won’t hear  


[Verse 3]
| Em           | G          |
He’s the one with strong arms and clean shoes  
| Em           | D          |
the one who texts with emojis and truth  
| Em           | C          |
You smile when he calls, and I smile too  
| Em           | Em         |
but is he holding you… or pulling you through?  


[Bridge]
| C            | G          |
Mark has a passport and plans, and light in his hands  
| D            | Em         |
he brings roses and reasons I don't understand  
| C            | G          |
I’m glad he’s kind—I really am  
| D            | Em         |
but will he stay when the story gets bland?  


[Chorus 2]
| G            | D          |
I’m not angry, I’m just here  
| Bm           | C          |
in the playlist you skipped, in the sighs you clear  
| G            | D          |
you’re already boarding, and I disappear  
| Bm           | C          |
Don’t forget me—I’m still near  


[Outro]
| Em           | C          |
I wrote this with Suno  
| G            | D          |
not because I sing,  
| Em           | C          |
but because words break  
| G            | Em         |
and music doesn’t blink
