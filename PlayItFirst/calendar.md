## 🌍 About

**Play It First – A Vista Challenge** is a cultural initiative curated by *Edizioni Tradizionali / CNOT Europa*.  
It brings unpublished scores into public spaces and invites musicians to perform them “a vista” — sight-reading, without ever having heard them before.

Each session is both a performance and a research act:  
a way to explore how sound, intuition, and attention can create meaning together.

At this stage, all *Play It First* sessions are **directly organized and curated**  
by *Edizioni Tradizionali / CNOT Europa*.

This approach ensures:
- consistency in artistic direction and tone,  
- coherent documentation and public communication,  
- accurate application of ethical and privacy principles.

Future collaborations with universities, art schools, and cultural associations  
will be considered after the pilot phase (2025–2026).

## 🪶 Note

*Play It First* is not a concert series — it is a **public research project** in sound, language, and presence.  
Every performance is both an experiment and a conversation.

> “Every note played for the first time is a small act of Europe.”
