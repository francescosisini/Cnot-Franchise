# 🎶 PLAY IT FIRST – A Vista Challenge  
### A public open music experiment by *Edizioni Tradizionali / CNOT Europa*

> “Play the music no one has ever heard before.”

## 🌍 What is Play It First?

**Play It First** is a public, open-air musical experiment created by *Edizioni Tradizionali* within the broader **CNOT 1.7** project.  
It invites musicians, students, and citizens to perform — for the very first time — original pieces that have never been heard before.  

Each performer receives a score, sits down, and plays it **a vista** (sight-reading), without any prior listening.  
The goal is not perfection, but the shared act of giving voice to something that doesn’t yet exist.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- To celebrate **music as spontaneous language**, not as a finished product.  
- To create **open public spaces** for genuine artistic expression.  
- To document and archive **first performances** as a collective act of creativity.  
- To connect artists, researchers, and citizens across Europe in a **shared cultural dialogue**.  

---

## 🧭 How It Works

1. **Join an official “Play It First” event**  
   See the list in [`/events`](events) (updated continuously).  

2. **Pick a score**  
   Scores are freely available in [`/scores`](scores). Each piece is simple, readable, and ready to play.  

3. **Perform and record**  
   Play the piece live — even if only a fragment. The essence is in the first encounter.

4. **Share your version**  
   - Upload via pull request to this repository, or  
   - Submit through the QR link provided during events.  

5. **Tag your performance**  
   Use the official hashtag **#PlayItFirstCNOT** on social media.

## 🌍 CNOT Europa

*Play It First* is part of **CNOT Europa**, a broader initiative that explores the meeting point between **art, technology, and human identity** within the European context.  

Just as *Leopardi* once helped shape Italy’s modern language, *CNOT* aims to articulate a new shared language for our time — one that bridges computation, creativity, and consciousness.  

> Europe is not only geography; it is the art of thinking together.
